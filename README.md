# AlmostProhibited - Frontend
A Tanstack Router, single page application, that is hacked together by someone that doesn't know how to do frontend properly.

## Getting Started
Install whatever the current Node.js LTS version is at the time of reading this. Currently, it is v24. I personally use `mise` to do this ([https://mise.jdx.dev/](https://mise.jdx.dev/)). You'll probably want `git` as well.

Afterwards, get started by cloning and performing a test build of the project:
```
git clone https://github.com/almostprohibited/frontend.git
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```
